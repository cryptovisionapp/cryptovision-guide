## Classify Transactions

We recommend that you journalize transactions on a regular basis for the purpose of calculating taxes to be paid at the end of the fiscal year and for your own portfolio management.

### Approval status of transactions
Transactions are classified into four categories based on their approval status.

#### ①Confirmation Required

<br />

"Confirmation Required" transactions are transactions that CryptoVision's proprietary algorithm has classified with a high degree of certainty, but that **you(users) need to confirm.** It is indicated by Yellow color.**If the transaction classification is correct, click the small check mark to the left.**  

Then it will turn green, as shown below.

**If the transaction classification is improper or you are not sure if it is correct, click on the transaction classification ("Receive NFT" in the above figure)**.

Then a pop-up will appear from the right, as shown below, and click on the appropriate journal entry.

What each transaction classification means is explained in [Understanding the different transaction classifications](./transaction-journal.md).

#### ②Highly Accurate

<img src="../assets/img/transaction-window-7.png" width="60%">

"Highly Accurate" transactions are transactions that you do not need to confirm because CryptoVision's proprietary algorithm has classified it with a sufficiently high degree of accuracy.
They are marked in green.
**You don't need to do anything with this one. **

#### ③Confirmed

①「要確認」にも掲載した図ですが、要確認の取引を「確認」すると、「確認済」のステータスになり、緑色になります。

#### ④ルール

<!-- <img src="../assets/img/transaction-window-11.png" width="60%"> -->

他の取引の分類を変更した時に「類似取引も同様に変更」をONの状態で変更すると、類似の取引も同じ分類として高精度に分類されます。この場合の承認ステータスは「ルール」となり、「高精度」と似たステータスになります。
表示形式は、上記のように紫色になります。
