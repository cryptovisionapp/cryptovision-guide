# Understanding different transaction classifications

We recommend that you journalize transactions on a regular basis for the purpose of calculating profits and losses and for your own portfolio management.

In order to select the appropriate transaction classification, you have to have a grasp of what each transaction classification means.
We recommend you read through this page for a detailed explanation of CryptoVision's transaction classifications.

## The structure of this page

First of all, a transaction consists of (up to)three types of tokens, which are **①Acquired tokens**, **② Lost tokens**, and **③Tokens paid as a fee**. (There is also a "moved token" only in the case of a "MoveBetweenWallets" transaction.)

And as for **③Tokens paid as a fee**, many of the transactions on the blockchain take gas fees, while those of off the blockchain are commonly not charged gas fees. In other words, there are two things that are unique to each transaction: **①Acquired tokens** and **②Lost tokens**.

Therefore, after explaining the **meaning of the transaction category**, we will explain the profit/loss calculation for each of **①Acquired tokens**, **②Lost tokens**　(and **③Tokens paid as a fee** for "MoveBetweenWallets" transactions only) in the **Calculation of Profit and Loss** section.

We will explain the **profit and loss calculation** for each transaction category, but as mentioned above, many of the transactions on the blockchain are subject to gas fees.
The market value of the tokens consumed for gas fees is subtracted as an expense from the value of the **profit and loss calculation** for each transaction category, and the result is the final P&L calculation for that transaction.
